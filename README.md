# TRIÈST

An implementation of TRIÈST-BASE and TRIÈST-IMPR in Scala using Apache Flink. Only supports undirected graphs.


TRIÈST is a family of one-pass streaming algorithms to compute unbiased, low-variance, high-quality approximations of the global and local number of triangles in a fully-dynamic graph represented as
an adversarial stream of edge insertions and deletions.
